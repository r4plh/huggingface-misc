Iterable Dataset (Streaming Mode):

When you use streaming=True with load_dataset() from the Hugging Face datasets library, the dataset behaves like a generator.
Generator Functions: They yield data items one at a time, which is particularly useful for processing each item sequentially without the need to load the entire dataset into memory.
Memory Efficiency: This method is highly memory-efficient, as it only loads the portion of data necessary for the current iteration, thus not requiring the entire dataset to fit into RAM.
Large Datasets: This approach is essential for handling very large datasets, potentially in the range of hundreds of gigabytes or more, that cannot be feasibly loaded entirely into local memory.
Use Case: Ideal for scenarios where data needs to be processed in a streaming fashion directly from a remote server or when working with constrained memory resources.
Normal Dataset (In-Memory):

Loading a dataset normally (without streaming=True) loads the entire data split into memory as a Dataset object.
In-Memory Access: All data is accessible at any time but requires enough memory to hold the entire dataset or split, which can be a limitation with large datasets.
Fast Access: In-memory datasets provide faster access to any data item since all data is already loaded, which is beneficial for operations requiring frequent access to various parts of the dataset.
Use Case: Best suited for datasets small enough to fit into memory or when multiple random accesses and manipulations are required.

Three methods to create iterable datasets:

Using Python Generators: Define a generator function to yield data items one at a time, enabling memory-efficient, lazy loading of data from any source.
Streaming with Hugging Face datasets: Load datasets in streaming mode using streaming=True in the load_dataset function, allowing data to be streamed and processed sequentially from remote sources.
Direct Conversion to Iterable Dataset: While there isn't a built-in to_iterable_dataset() method in Hugging Face datasets, you can use similar methods in other libraries (like TensorFlow's as_numpy_iterator()) to convert dataset objects into iterable formats within specific frameworks.
